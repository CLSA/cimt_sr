This document outlines the process for obtaining
carotid intima media thickness measurements (cIMT) from
structured report (SR) files stored in DICOM format
as part of the CLSA comprehensive cohort data stream.

1) create a text file "uidlist.txt" containing participant UID's
of the form A1234567, one row per UID unquoted: download
the SAC Opal view cIMT-qc/CarotidIntimaMeta to csv and
edit accordingly

2) create a credentials file "pwdfile" containing a password
for access to SAC Opal

3) compile the command line OpalHttp utility for dowloading
data from SAC Opal

4) create a view in SAC Opal to the SR files with variables for 
left and right sides SR binary files - see aux/CarotidIntimaData.xml

5) configure and run the bash script "get_cIMT_SR" which will
pull the SR files from SAC Opal and store them to disk on
the host machine of the script

6) build cimt_sr_pair_files from source and run
with appropriate command line inputs: eg.
~/files/builds/cimt/cimt_sr_pair_files --output <name of output file> <name of input data folder>
